# Project: Impact of Weather & Other Factors on Premier League Goals
## Overview
This project investigates whether weather conditions, crowd attendance, referees, and the introduction of VAR have an impact on the number of goals scored in the Premier League. The focus is on teams based in London (Arsenal, Chelsea, etc.) and Manchester (Man City, Man United).

## Data Sources
- Match Data: Kaggleâ€™s Premier League dataset (2000/2001, 2001/2002, 2020/2021, 2021/2022 seasons).
- Weather Data: Collected from Visual Crossing, covering temperature, rainfall, humidity, and wind speed.
- Attendance Data: Available only for 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 seasons.
- VAR Comparison: Checking goal trends before and after VAR (Video Assistant Referee) introduction.

## Key Questions Explored
- Does temperature impact the number of goals scored?
- Do other weather factors (rain, humidity, wind) play a role?
- Does a higher crowd attendance lead to more goals?
- Do some referees influence the game more (e.g. red cards)?
- How did the introduction of VAR change goal-scoring patterns?
- Does the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) impact goals scored?
